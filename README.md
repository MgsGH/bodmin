Bird observatory "system"
This is essentially a tailor made CMS for bird observatories. The system contains a back-end coupled with a web site. Everything sits under on common (HTML) root. 

The system is built using PHP in the back-end and JQuery. A number of extra js libraries are used. Of course Bootstrap, but also others.
